# 🏥 Hospital / Patient Management System (Python OOP Project)

This project is a **Hospital / Patient Management System** built in **Python**.  
It demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)** concepts such as:

✔️ Classes & Objects  
✔️ Inheritance  
✔️ Polymorphism (Method Overriding)  
✔️ Encapsulation  
✔️ Loops & Menu-driven Programming  

---

## 📌 Features
- Add new **patients** with details (ID, name, age, disease).
- Add new **doctors** with details (name, specialization, age, gender).
- View all patients.
- View all doctors.
- Simple menu-driven program for easy navigation.

## 🏗️ OOP Concepts Used
1. **Classes & Objects** → `Person`, `Patient`, `Doctor`, `Hospital`.  
2. **Inheritance** → `Patient` and `Doctor` inherit from `Person`.  
3. **Polymorphism** → Method overriding (`display_details`).  
4. **Encapsulation** → Patient and doctor details are inside classes.  
5. **Loops** → While loop for menu, For loop for listing records.
